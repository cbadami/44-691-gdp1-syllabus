    <h3>Schedule</h3>
    Note: Course schedule is subject to change with instructor notification and students will be responsible for abiding by these
    changes.

    <h3>Expectations</h3>
    This course includes the development of unique, creative applications. Students should expect to spend at least 2-3 hours
    on out-of-class work for every one hour of instruction.


    <h3>Instructional Methods and Techniques </h3>

    Instructional methods include lectures, class discussions, individual work, small group work, learner presentations, client
    discussions, guest speakers, and collaborative development.

    <h3>Participation/Attendance </h3>

    Students are expected to attend all classes as specified in the course syllabi for each course. This course has many in-class
    activities, most of which have points and may not be announced in advance. Students arriving late or missing activities
    due to unexcused absences may not be able to make up work and may earn zero points for the activity.

    <h3>Excused absences</h3>

    <p>Excused absences include attendance at a university sponsored event (documented with an excuse signed by the university
      sponsor prior to the event) or by circumstances considered extenuating by the course instructor. It is the responsibility
      of the student to promptly notify his or her instructor when unable to attend class. Please refer to the
      <a href="https://www.nwmissouri.edu/policies/academics/Attendance.pdf ">university policy on attendance</a>.</p>

    <p>A student may make up class work without penalty if engaged in University activities endorsed by the Provost or prevented
      from attending by circumstances considered adequately extenuating by the course instructor. </p>

    <p>After the add period until the end of the drop period, an instructor may request the Office of the Registrar to delete
      a student from the class roster due to non-attendance.</p>
